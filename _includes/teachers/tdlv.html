<p>Terry de la Vega, NP, CYN became an RN, then a Nurse
						Practitioner because of her passion for women’s health. As time
						went on, she felt drawn to explore the deeper aspects of mind/body
						health and healing. Having practiced yoga and meditation off and
						on since she was a teenager, becoming a yoga teacher was the path
						she chose. Since she completed the 200-hour Kripalu Yoga Teacher
						Training, as well as specific training in creating classes for
						pregnancy, back care, meditation, addiction recovery, and anxiety
						and depression, Terry has taught classes off and on in the Potsdam
						area, while continuing to work full time as an NP. In 2013 Terry
						was delighted to become a Certified YogaNurse®. This brand new
						specialty combines the ancient wisdom of yoga with the modern
						science of nursing.</p>
						
	<p>				As well as teaching yoga classes, Terry sees clients at
						Trillium for yoga therapy sessions in her business Light on
						Healing Yoga.</p>
						
					<p>Terry believes everyone can do yoga. All they need to do is
						to start where they are and do what they are able to do in the
						moment with awareness and compassion. Doing yoga creates unity and
						wholeness leading to inner peace and connection with the divine.
						She has seen amazing healing and relief of pain and suffering in
						her self and her students.</p>

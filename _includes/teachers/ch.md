Cintia F. Hongay, PhD, RMT, RYT, has been
					practicing yoga for more than 19 years. Her first training was in
					the Iyengar method where she gained a good knowledge of body
					alignment and proper use of yoga props to help the body achieve the
					full expression of an asana and to relax into the pose in a safe,
					mindful, meditative way. She will help students of all body types
					achieve their full expression of yoga postures with awareness and
					mindfulness. Cintia recently received her 200-hour Kripalu Yoga
					Teacher certification. In addition, she has taken yoga trainings
					for back pain, proper pelvic alignment, meditation, and the
					Franklin Method. Cintia is a full-time biology teacher and
					researcher at Clarkson University. Born in La Plata Argentina,
					Cintia lived in Italy before acquiring her American citizenship.
					She brings a multicultural approach to her teachings and a deep
					understanding of the science behind yoga.

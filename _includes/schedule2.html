		<h2>How to register for classes</h2>
    <p><b>Session Classes</b>: Contact the teacher of the class you wish to take. Teacher contact
			information is located on the teacher information page which pops up when you click on the
			teacherâ€™s name. When you come to Trillium for the first time for a session class, you will
			sign a registration form and a liability release form. You will pay the teacher for the full
			session. Please note: Most teachers allow drop-in students to attend their session classes.
			If the class is closed to drop-ins, it will be clearly stated in the class description.</p>
		<p><b>On-going classes</b>: When you come to Trillium for the first time, you will sign a
			registration form and a liability release form. You may pay for your class as a drop-in
			student or the you may purchase a 10-class card. The 10 class card will be initialed by
			the teacher every time you take a class. You may only use 10-class cards for ongoing classes.
			Cards will stay at Trillium and you will be shown how to retrieve and use your card.</p>

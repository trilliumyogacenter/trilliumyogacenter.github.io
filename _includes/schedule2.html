		<h2>How to register for classes</h2>
    <p><b>Session Classes</b>: Contact the teacher of the class you wish to take. Teacher contact
			information is located on the teacher information page which pops up when you click on the
			teacher’s name. When you come to Trillium for the first time for a session class, you will
			sign a registration form and a liability release form. You will pay the teacher for the full
			session. Please note: Most teachers allow drop-in students to attend their session classes.
			If the class is closed to drop-ins, it will be clearly stated in the class description.</p>
		<p><b>On-going classes</b>: When you come to Trillium for the first time, you will sign a
			registration form and a liability release form. You may pay for your class as a drop-in
			student or the you may purchase a 10-class card. The 10 class card will be initialed by
			the teacher every time you take a class. You may only use 10-class cards for ongoing classes.
			Cards will stay at Trillium and you will be shown how to retrieve and use your card.</p>

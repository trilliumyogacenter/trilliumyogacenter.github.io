  <h2>International Day of Yoga</h2>
  <h3>June 18, 6 am - 2 pm</h3>
  <img style="width:100%;max-width:100%" src="/images/sunsalutation.png">
  <p>Join us at Trillium in the celebration of International Day of Yoga. A resolution
    proclaiming International Day of Yoga was initially introduced by the Prime
    Minister of India, endorsed by the United Nations, and affirmed that:</p>
  <p><em>"Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, thought and action,... a holistic
    approach that is valuable to our health and wellbeing. Yoga is not just about
    exercise; it is a way to discover a sense of oneness with yourself, the world,
    and nature."</em></p>
  <p>Help raise awareness of the many benefits of practicing yoga.</p>
  <p>Greet the day with a joyful series of <strong>108 Sun Salutations</strong>. Meeting at 6:00 a.m.,
    a brief, seated meditation will precede the morning practice. Continuous rounds of
    classic sun salutations will be offered with the intention of creating a moving
    meditation. Those interested in participating can join in at any time, complete
    as many sun salutations as your body comfortably allows, and leave when desired.</p>
  <p>All proceeds from this class will go directly to Trillium in order to continue
    to maintain classes and offerings for our community. Feel free to contribute at
    whatever level you feel comfortable.</p>
  <p>Our regular <strong>Community Yoga</strong> will be held at the Gazebo in Ives Park at the usual
    time, 9:00 am – 10:00 am.</p>
  <p><strong>Pregnancy Yoga</strong> with Terry de la Vega follows at Trillium from
    10:30 am – 12:00 noon.</p>
  <p>The last class of the day will be <strong>Yoga for Unlocking Your Potential</strong>
    with Amanda Stopa form 1:00 pm – 2:00 pm.</p>
  <p>Participants may pay a class fee at whatever level they are comfortable,
    $5 - $10 per class is suggested.</p>

  <p>Fee: $10</p>
  <p>Do you want to introduce more balance into your life and gain new tools to

    more recent cognitive-behavioral techniques. The one hour session will provide
    an overview of the concept of wise mind and mindfulness practice. The class
    will include a brief lecture, handouts, discussion among participants and direct
    examples of techniques that participants can use right away such as 1) a focus
    on breathing and 2) guided visualization. Please note that this is not a yoga or
    exercise class.</p>
  <p>The instructor, Alisa G. Woods, PhD, LMHC is a licensed mental health counselor,
    with specialized additional training in mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy,

  <h2>Mindfulness Immersion Workshop</h2>
  <img src="/images/bradt.jpg" width="214" height="320 hspace="10 align="right">
  <h3>Charlie Bradt:</h3>
  <p>Fee: $35, pre-registration preferred, Saturday, September 24, 1 pm – 4 pm,
    contact <a href="mailto:shannon@trilliumyogacenter.com">shannon@trilliumyogacenter.com</a></p>
  <p>Mindfulness is a process of literally turning our world inside out. We've all
    been taught to believe that the source of our problems​ is "out there," in the
    people and events of our lives. Mindfulness says no, the problems are "in here,"
    in the workings of our minds. Which is actually really good news, because if
    they're "in here," we can do something about them (problems.)</p>
  <p>This half-day workshop will give you a chance to look at your world with
    different eyes, and offer some tools to take with you to begin the process
    of trading in some stress for a little more peace.​ This workshop would be
    useful for those just curious as well as those wishing to start a practice.<p>
  <p><strong>Charlie Bradt</strong> has been teaching and practicing yoga and meditation for over
    20 years. In the last four years, he has taught the deeper practice of
    Mindfulness and Mindful Meditation. Charlie was founder of the Yoga Loft.</p>

  <h2>Retreat for Empaths, Healers, and other Sensitive People</h2>
  <img src="/images/montan.jpeg" width="100" height="75" hspace="10" align="right">
  <h3>With Kathy Montan, BCET, RSMT, Body-Centered Expressive Therapist and a
    Registered Somatic Movement Therapist</h3>
  <h3>Saturday, March 5, 10:30 am - 4:30 pm</h3>
  <p>There will be a 45 minute break for lunch. You may eat at a downtown
  restaurant or bring a bag lunch.</p>
  <p><strong>Fee $75</strong><p>
  <p>A lot of us are clairsentient, which means that we pick up on the feelings
    of those around us. Sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes it's too
    much of a good thing. This retreat is a way to explore ways (both
    energetically and more concretely) to create boundaries around our innate
    abilities. If you feel that you sometimes take on the pain of others, this
    retreat/workshop will help you. We will be doing a combination of dialog,
    movement, teaching sessions, guided meditations, and creative expression.
    You will learn skills for what to do before difficult or emotional
    encounters, during the encounters, and afterwards if you feel drained.</p>
  <p>For sensitive people, the chance to come into community with others who
    are like themselves can be invaluable. We learn from each other and feel
    supported in a very rich and empowering way.</p>
  <p><strong>Feedback from participants who have attended previous retreats:</strong></p>
   <ul>
   <li>"This was great. Loved the combination of right/left brain activities.
     Was very tight when I can and was loose and relaxed and optimistic when I
     left."</li>
   <li>"Enjoyed all aspects. The science, the art, movement. We did a lot for
    ourselves."</li>
   <li>"I can't believe how much I got out of this workshop!! I wouldn't change
    anything you did.  The pace was good, the balance of moving, sitting,
    thinking was good. Time flew. Offer it again!"</li>

Beth Robinson, Certified Alexander Technique Teacher. </p>
<img src="/images/headshots/BethRobinson.jpg" width="214" height="320 hspace="10 align="right">
<p>Our bodies are designed to move with energy, balance, and ease. Too often, our lifestyles interfere
  with this design, resulting in tension, unnecessary effort, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Learn how our every day movements, such as sitting down, standing up, and walking, may create
  unnecessary tension in our bodies. Through increased awareness, and gentle hands-on guidance
  from the teacher, we create the possibility for change.</p>
<p>The Alexander Technique allows us the opportunity to recognize and even undo habits that often
  lead to strain and stress.</p>
<p>The Alexander Technique is a proven, safe, self care method to stop pain, stress and muscular
  tension caused by everyday misuse of the body. People who learn this unique, sophisticated
  method can enhance their movement, function, and performance skills. You can apply what you
  learn through Alexander Technique to improved use of the body in such areas as instrumental
  and singing techniques, dance, athletics, and daily life activities.</p>
<p>“The Alexander Technique doesn’t teach you something new to do. It teaches you how to
  bring more practical intelligence into what you are already doing; how to eliminate
  stereotyped responses; how to deal with habit and change. It leaves you free to choose your
  own goal but gives you a better use of yourself while you work toward it.” Frank Pierce Jones,
  Body Awareness in Action</p>
<h3>What can it do for You?</h3>

      <h3>Saturday, May 14, 2016, 1:00 - 2:30 pm</h3>
      <p>Join us at Trillium for partner yoga and reap its benefits while creating
        a happy, healthy, and joyful experience. Though it can be lighthearted
        and fun, it's guaranteed that you will gain new perspective as you
        investigate classic yoga postures with a partner.</p>
      <p>Doing yoga with a partner makes many poses more accessible,
        comfortable, and even therapeutic. This is a simple and accessible
        practice - even for inflexible yoga novices.</p>
      <p>Preregistration is strongly encouraged, as a pair or a single.</p>

        <h2>Shine On - Yoga Nidra Workshops with Shannon Miller</h2>
  <img src="/images/headshots/miller.jpeg" width="214" height="320" hspace="10" align="right">
        <p><strong>Sunday May 15 - 1-2:30,  $20</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Tuesday May 17- 7-8:30,  $20</strong></p>
        <h3>What is Yoga Nidra?</h3>
        <p>Can you imagine experiencing deeper levels of health, inner peace of
        mind, and equanimity?
        <p>Modern life leads people to believe that they are relaxing when they
          drop themselves onto the couch, turn on the TV, reach for a drink,
          cigarette, coffee, or a good book. These sensory diversions are not
          the true definition of relaxation. Deep, absolute relaxation is an
          experience far beyond this. Deep relaxation and inner awareness is
          healing and transformative on many levels.<p>
        <p>Allow me to share with you the practice of Yoga Nidra: Yoga, meaning
          union or one-pointed awareness, and Nidra, meaning sleep. Often referred
          to as Divine or Yogic Sleep, this contemporary practice is based on
          ancient meditation and yogic wisdom. Yoga Nidra is a powerful technique
          in which you are guided systematically and learn to relax consciously
          at every level of your being. Yoga Nidra invites you to experience a
          body scan and breath awareness, as well as a visual and sense component
          through your physical, energetic, mental, emotional and spiritual
          layers. With no need to fix or change anything about yourself, you
          simply notice. In this dawn between sleep and wakefulness you are
          invited to throw off the burdens, the tensions of life.</p>
          <p><strong>During this workshop we will explore more deeply</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>The History of Yoga Nidra</li>
            <li>A centering meditation</li>
            <li>What is Yoga Nidra?</li>
            <li>The five Koshas or bodies of our being</li>
            <li>Who can practice Yoga Nidra?</li>
            <li>When and Where?</li>
            <li>Why - what are the benefits?</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Our time together looks something like this:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>15-20 minutes of history, context, centering, benefits</li>
            <li>15 -20 minutes of very gentle movement</li>
            <li>35- 45 minutes of Yoga Nidra</li>
            <li>10-15 minutes of integration</li>
          </ul>

<h3>Friday, October 23 at 7:30 pm</h3> 
<p>Tickets: $12</p>
<p>Grammy Award-nominated flutist and four-time Native American Music Award nominee Peter Phippen returns to Potsdam to

<p>Phippen, who grew up in nearby Buckton, is an internationally acclaimed world flutes musician and composer who records and performs
  music that draws on Native American folk tradition and other folk traditions to create a uniquely ethereal sound. His music has been

  reflections” (Music Design).</p>
<p>Two of his songs, “Night Song” and “Lullabye,” are currently featured on the digital download  compilation, “Native American
  Flute Music for Meditation” (Canyon Records), that is  #48 on iTunes World Music.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful opportunity to experience Peter Phippens’ transformative music,” said Robin McClellan, who is organizing

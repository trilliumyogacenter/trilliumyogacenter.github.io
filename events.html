  <h2>Retreat for Empaths, Healers, and other Sensitive People</h2>
  <img src="/images/montan.jpeg" width="100" height="75" hspace="10" align="right">
  <h3>With Kathy Montan, BCET, RSMT, Body-Centered Expressive Therapist and a
    Registered Somatic Movement Therapist</h3>
  <h3>Saturday, March 5, 10:30 am - 4:30 pm</h3>
  <p>There will be a 45 minute break for lunch. You may eat at a downtown
  restaurant or bring a bag lunch.</p>
  <p><strong>Fee $75</strong><p>
  <p>A lot of us are clairsentient, which means that we pick up on the feelings
    of those around us. Sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes it's too
    much of a good thing. This retreat is a way to explore ways (both
    energetically and more concretely) to create boundaries around our innate
    abilities. If you feel that you sometimes take on the pain of others, this
    retreat/workshop will help you. We will be doing a combination of dialog,
    movement, teaching sessions, guided meditations, and creative expression.
    You will learn skills for what to do before difficult or emotional
    encounters, during the encounters, and afterwards if you feel drained.</p>
  <p>For sensitive people, the chance to come into community with others who
    are like themselves can be invaluable. We learn from each other and feel
    supported in a very rich and empowering way.</p>
  <p><strong>Feedback from participants who have attended previous retreats:</strong></p>
   <ul>
   <li>"This was great. Loved the combination of right/left brain activities.
     Was very tight when I can and was loose and relaxed and optimistic when I
     left."</li>
   <li>"Enjoyed all aspects. The science, the art, movement. We did a lot for
    ourselves."</li>
   <li>"I can't believe how much I got out of this workshop!! I wouldn't change
    anything you did.  The pace was good, the balance of moving, sitting,
    thinking was good. Time flew. Offer it again!"</li>

Beth Robinson, Certified Alexander Technique Teacher. </p>
<img src="/images/headshots/BethRobinson.jpg" width="214" height="320 hspace="10 align="right">
<p>Our bodies are designed to move with energy, balance, and ease. Too often, our lifestyles interfere
  with this design, resulting in tension, unnecessary effort, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Learn how our every day movements, such as sitting down, standing up, and walking, may create
  unnecessary tension in our bodies. Through increased awareness, and gentle hands-on guidance
  from the teacher, we create the possibility for change.</p>
<p>The Alexander Technique allows us the opportunity to recognize and even undo habits that often
  lead to strain and stress.</p>
<p>The Alexander Technique is a proven, safe, self care method to stop pain, stress and muscular
  tension caused by everyday misuse of the body. People who learn this unique, sophisticated
  method can enhance their movement, function, and performance skills. You can apply what you
  learn through Alexander Technique to improved use of the body in such areas as instrumental
  and singing techniques, dance, athletics, and daily life activities.</p>
<p>“The Alexander Technique doesn’t teach you something new to do. It teaches you how to
  bring more practical intelligence into what you are already doing; how to eliminate
  stereotyped responses; how to deal with habit and change. It leaves you free to choose your
  own goal but gives you a better use of yourself while you work toward it.” Frank Pierce Jones,
  Body Awareness in Action</p>

    <p><strong><em>What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon
      and three legs in the evening?</em></strong></p>
    <p><em>--The Riddle of the Sphinx</em></p>
    <p>How is it that people learn to move and walk on two legs and yet over time, lose the ability to
      walk upright and wind up walking with a cane or some form of support? From this perspective we may
      think that aging or growing older means to become debilitated or crippled. But is that really
      true?</p>
    <p>What if the idea of aging was simply a myth and we could learn to move easily without pain and
      stiffness well into our golden years?</p>
    <p>Students will explore and expose the myth of aging. Using innovative research and techniques,
      you&rsquo;ll learn how to reverse the aging process and what it actually means to age. We&rsquo;ll
      look at why we continue to believe something that simply isn&rsquo;t true and how we are socialized
      to believe the myth of aging. </p>
    <p>In addition, we&rsquo;ll practice a series of movements that will relax your muscles and leave
      you feeling centered in your body and calm in your mind. You will notice a marked
      difference in the way you feel and move. </p>
    <p>If you want to slow down your aging process and learn to move fluidly in your body, then this
      somatics is for you!</p>
    <p>Richard&rsquo;s bio:</p>
    <p>An educator with a variety of teaching experience, Richard has explored Somatic movement for
      over 10 years. He completed 2 years of Somatic Experiencing, a form of trauma training, and
      spent over 8 years studying Hanna Somatic Education. Richard is also certified Somayog teacher,
      a style of yoga, which uses Somatic movement and yogic breathing.</p>
    <p>He is inspired by the Somatic perspective of <em>less is more</em>. Richard encourages
      students to explore how they move and to be attentive while they practice. Through this,
      students discover their felt sense and greater body awareness</p>

<h2><img src="/images/headshots/phippen.jpg" align="right" hspace="5">Former North Country Resident and Grammy Award-Nominee Flutist Peter Phippen in Concert</h2>
<p><strong>To benefit the Alzheimer's Association</strong></p>
<h3>Friday, October 23 at 7:30 pm</h3> 
<p>Tickets: $12</p>
<p>Grammy Award-nominated flutist and four-time Native American Music Award nominee Peter Phippen returns to Potsdam to
  perform in concert on Friday, October 23 at 7: 30 p.m.</p>
<p>The concert will be held at the Trillium Center for Yoga &amp; Health at 25 Market Street in downtown Potsdam.
  A portion of the proceeds from the concert will benefit the Alzheimer’s Association.  Tickets are $12 and can be purchased at the door.</p>
<p>Phippen, who grew up in nearby Buckton, is an internationally acclaimed world flutes musician and composer who records and performs
  music that draws on Native American folk tradition and other folk traditions to create a uniquely ethereal sound. His music has been
  described as “earthy, improvised and impressionistic, offering listeners a beautifully serene atmosphere for meditation and
  reflections” (Music Design).</p>
<p>Two of his songs, “Night Song” and “Lullabye,” are currently featured on the digital download  compilation, “Native American
  Flute Music for Meditation” (Canyon Records), that is  #48 on iTunes World Music.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful opportunity to experience Peter Phippens’ transformative music,” said Robin McClellan, who is organizing
  the concert.  “And the meditative space of the Trillium Yoga studio provides the ideal setting.”</p>

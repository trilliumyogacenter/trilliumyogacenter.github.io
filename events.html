<img src="/images/headshots/BethRobinson.jpg" width="214" height="320 hspace="10 align="right"><p>Our bodies are designed to move with energy, balance, and ease. Too often, our lifestyles interfere
  with this design, resulting in tension, unnecessary effort, and fatigue.</p>
<p>Learn how our every day movements, such as sitting down, standing up, and walking, may create
  unnecessary tension in our bodies. Through increased awareness, and gentle hands-on guidance
  from the teacher, we create the possibility for change.</p>
<p>The Alexander Technique allows us the opportunity to recognize and even undo habits that often
  lead to strain and stress.</p>
<p>The Alexander Technique is a proven, safe, self care method to stop pain, stress and muscular
  tension caused by everyday misuse of the body. People who learn this unique, sophisticated
  method can enhance their movement, function, and performance skills. You can apply what you
  learn through Alexander Technique to improved use of the body in such areas as instrumental
  and singing techniques, dance, athletics, and daily life activities.</p>
<p>“The Alexander Technique doesn’t teach you something new to do. It teaches you how to
  bring more practical intelligence into what you are already doing; how to eliminate
  stereotyped responses; how to deal with habit and change. It leaves you free to choose your
  own goal but gives you a better use of yourself while you work toward it.” Frank Pierce Jones,
  Body Awareness in Action</p>

<h2>The Myth of Aging: A Somatic Perspective</h2>
<img src="/images/hudspith.jpeg" width="214" height="320 hspace="10 align="right">
<h3>A special weekend with Richard Hudspith:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Friday, January 29: Somatics class, 7:00-8:30 pm. Drop-in: $15 </li>
<li>Saturday, January 30: Workshop 2:00-4:30 pm - preregistration recommended, $40</li>

<p><strong><em>What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon and three legs in the evening?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>--The Riddle of the Sphinx</em></p>
<p>How is it that people learn to move and walk on two legs and yet over time, lose the ability to
  walk upright and wind up walking with a cane or some form of support? From this perspective we may
  think that aging or growing older means to become debilitated or crippled. But is that really
  true?</p>
<p>What if the idea of aging was simply a myth and we could learn to move easily without pain and
  stiffness well into our golden years? </p>
<p>This workshop will explore and expose the myth of aging. Using innovative research and techniques,
  you&rsquo;ll learn how to reverse the aging process and what it actually means to age. We&rsquo;ll
  look at why we continue to believe something that simply isn&rsquo;t true and how we are socialized
  to believe the myth of aging. </p>
<p>In addition, we&rsquo;ll practice a series of movements that will relax your muscles and leave
  you feeling centered in your body and calm in your mind. No matter how you feel at the start of
  the workshop, by the end you will notice a marked difference in the way you feel and move. </p>
<p>If you want to slow down your aging process and learn to move fluidly in your body, then this
  workshop is you!</p>
<p><strong>Richard Hudspith</strong>: An educator with a variety of teaching experience, Richard has explored Somatic movement for
  over 10 years. He completed 2 years of Somatic Experiencing, a form of trauma training, and
  spent over 8 years studying Hanna Somatic Education. Richard is also certified Somayog teacher,
  a style of yoga, which uses Somatic movement and yogic breathing.</p>
<p>He is inspired by the Somatic perspective of <em>less is more</em>. Richard encourages
  students to explore how they move and to be attentive while they practice. Through this,
  students discover their felt sense and greater body awareness</p>

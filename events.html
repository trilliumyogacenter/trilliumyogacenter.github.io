<p><strong>To benefit the Alzheimer's Association</strong></p>
<h3>Friday, October 23 at 7:30 pm</h3> 
<p>Tickets: $12</p>
<p>Grammy Award-nominated flutist and four-time Native American Music Award nominee Peter Phippen returns to Potsdam to
  perform in concert on Friday, October 23 at 7: 30 p.m.</p>
<p>The concert will be held at the Trillium Center for Yoga &amp; Health at 25 Market Street in downtown Potsdam.
  A portion of the proceeds from the concert will benefit the Alzheimer’s Association.  Tickets are $12 and can be purchased at the door.</p>
<p>Phippen, who grew up in nearby Buckton, is an internationally acclaimed world flutes musician and composer who records and performs
  music that draws on Native American folk tradition and other folk traditions to create a uniquely ethereal sound. His music has been
  described as “earthy, improvised and impressionistic, offering listeners a beautifully serene atmosphere for meditation and
  reflections” (Music Design).</p>
<p>Two of his songs, “Night Song” and “Lullabye,” are currently featured on the digital download  compilation, “Native American
  Flute Music for Meditation” (Canyon Records), that is  #48 on iTunes World Music.</p>
<p>“This is a wonderful opportunity to experience Peter Phippens’ transformative music,” said Robin McClellan, who is organizing
  the concert.  “And the meditative space of the Trillium Yoga studio provides the ideal setting.”</p>

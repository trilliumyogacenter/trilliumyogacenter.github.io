<h2>The Myth of Aging: A Somatic Perspective</h2>
<img src="/images/hudspith.jpeg" width="214" height="320" hspace="10" align="right">
<h3>A special weekend with Richard Hudspith:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Friday, January 29: Somatics class, 7:00-8:30 pm. Drop-in: $15 </li>
<li>Saturday, January 30: Workshop 2:00-4:30 pm - preregistration recommended, $40</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><em>What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon and three legs in the evening?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>--The Riddle of the Sphinx</em></p>
<p>How is it that people learn to move and walk on two legs and yet over time, lose the ability to
  walk upright and wind up walking with a cane or some form of support? From this perspective we may
  think that aging or growing older means to become debilitated or crippled. But is that really
  true?</p>
<p>What if the idea of aging was simply a myth and we could learn to move easily without pain and
  stiffness well into our golden years? </p>
<p>This workshop will explore and expose the myth of aging. Using innovative research and techniques,
  you&rsquo;ll learn how to reverse the aging process and what it actually means to age. We&rsquo;ll
  look at why we continue to believe something that simply isn&rsquo;t true and how we are socialized
  to believe the myth of aging. </p>
<p>In addition, we&rsquo;ll practice a series of movements that will relax your muscles and leave
  you feeling centered in your body and calm in your mind. No matter how you feel at the start of
  the workshop, by the end you will notice a marked difference in the way you feel and move. </p>
<p>If you want to slow down your aging process and learn to move fluidly in your body, then this
  workshop is you!</p>

<p>He is inspired by the Somatic perspective of <em>less is more</em>. Richard encourages
  students to explore how they move and to be attentive while they practice. Through this,
  students discover their felt sense and greater body awareness</p>

  <h2>Retreat for Empaths, Healers, and other Sensitive People</h2>
  <img src="/images/montan.jpeg" width="100" height="75" hspace="10" align="right">
  <h3>With Kathy Montan, BCET, RSMT, Body-Centered Expressive Therapist and a
    Registered Somatic Movement Therapist</h3>
  <p><strong>Saturday, March 5, 10:30 am - 4:30 pm</strong>.<br>
  There will be a 45 minute break for lunch. You may eat at a downtown 
  restaurant or bring a bag lunch.</p>
  <p><strong>Fee $75</strong><p>
  <p>A lot of us are clairsentient, which means that we pick up on the feelings
    of those around us. Sometimes this is a good thing and sometimes it's too
    much of a good thing. This retreat is a way to explore ways (both
    energetically and more concretely) to create boundaries around our innate
    abilities. If you feel that you sometimes take on the pain of others, this
    retreat/workshop will help you. We will be doing a combination of dialog,
    movement, teaching sessions, guided meditations, and creative expression.
    You will learn skills for what to do before difficult or emotional
    encounters, during the encounters, and afterwards if you feel drained.</p>
  <p>For sensitive people, the chance to come into community with others who
    are like themselves can be invaluable. We learn from each other and feel
    supported in a very rich and empowering way.</p>
  <p><strong>Feedback from participants who have attended previous retreats:</strong></p>
   <ul>
   <li>"This was great. Loved the combination of right/left brain activities.
     Was very tight when I can and was loose and relaxed and optimistic when I
     left."</li>
   <li>"Enjoyed all aspects. The science, the art, movement. We did a lot for
    ourselves."</li>
   <li>"I can't believe how much I got out of this workshop!! I wouldn't change
    anything you did.  The pace was good, the balance of moving, sitting,
    thinking was good. Time flew. Offer it again!"</li>

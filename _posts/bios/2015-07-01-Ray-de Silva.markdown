I am a long-term meditator and have studied meditation for many years. I have taught
meditation for focus and stress reduction at St. Lawrence Addiction Treatment Center
from 1995 to 2015. I was also certified for and practiced detox acupuncture and taught
an intro yoga class for the patients.  I helped build a walking labyrinth and instructed
patients and staff in its use.

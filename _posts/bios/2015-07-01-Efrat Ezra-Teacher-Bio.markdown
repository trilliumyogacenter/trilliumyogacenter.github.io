Efrat completed yoga teacher training at High Desert Yoga in Albuquerque New Mexico with Kim Schwartz and Zoreh Afsarzadeh. She currently teaches Hatha and heated Hatha classes at the Yoga Loft in Canton.

Efratâ€™s yoga practice combines guided breath and asana, foundational classic inversions, and reorganizes body posture in order to achieve progress in any personal yoga practice. Her class also combines creative Vinyasa and restorative relaxation.

Efrat was born and raised in Israel and moved to the United States in 2006.

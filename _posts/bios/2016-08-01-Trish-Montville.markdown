Trish began her yoga practice about ten years ago, looking for a complement to her gym routine. What she didn't anticipate was the sense of calm and peace she found in connecting movement to breath. As a middle school teacher for over twenty years, yoga is a gift she loves to share with her students.

Her classroom teaching, the advice of a great mentor, and a deepening personal practice led her to complete her 200 hour Hatha Yoga Teacher training in August 2016 at PranaShanti Yoga Centre in Ottawa. As a new yoga teacher, Trish hopes to provide classes that allow her students to feel the same way she feels every time she steps on a mat- blissful, creative, and calm. Namaste!

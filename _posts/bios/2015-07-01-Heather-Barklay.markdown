I have been practicing yoga for the past 10 years. I started out by buying a yoga DVD as a way to get some exercise when it was too icy to run in the winter. I was quickly hooked. Soon my sister and I were doing different yoga DVDs almost every night of the week. We went on to take yoga classes at the Yoga Loft and other places, and eventually both became certified teachers ourselves. I completed my 200 hour certification at Kripalu in June 2015. I aim to offer classes that are accessible to everyone, especially those who may not think of themselves as the “yoga type.” I work as a social worker in Ogdensburg. When I am not working or teaching yoga I like to spend my time exploring the Adirondacks.

Positional Therapy. Developed by neuromuscular therapist Lee Albert, NMT, Integrated Positional Therapy (IPT) incorporates techniques such as Strain/Counterstrain, Muscle Energy Technique, stretching and home care to re-align the body’s structure and relieve pain caused by structural imbalances. IPT effectively treats pain patterns caused by injury, stress, repetitive strain, postural distortion and chronic neuromuscular conditions.

Phoenix Rising Yoga Therapy . Combining classical yoga and meditation techniques with elements of contemporary talk therapy, PRYT facilitates you accessing your inherent wisdom and healing abilities, leading to the release of underlying tension and beliefs that manifest as chronic pain, illness, or an unsatisfying life.

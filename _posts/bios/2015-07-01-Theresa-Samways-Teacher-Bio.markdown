I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who enjoys working with people who have made a commitment to their health and personal growth. My approach is tailored to fit the needs of the client, so clients can feel comfortable and understood, which frees them to focus on solving their problems and improving their well-being. My prior experience is in counseling middle and high school students, college students and adults on issues including, but not limited to: depression, life transitions, relationship problems, grief, stress, and abuse. I have opened a private practice in Potsdam, NY, in an effort to provide mental health services to support the North Country community.

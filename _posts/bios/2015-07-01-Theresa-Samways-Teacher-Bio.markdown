Debra Mitchell has over 25 years experience in the areas of psychology and self- development. She has devoted much of her life to the healing and spiritual process since learning transcendental meditation at the age of 17. One of her greatest joys is to support and help others on their own unique life journey.

Using a creative, intuitive and holistic approach, traditional and non-traditional, Debra specializes in working with children, families, and adults in the areas of depression, anxiety, life transitions, trauma, behavior problems, loss/grief, spiritual journeying and more. She is trained in Art and Play therapy as well as Sand Tray Therapy.

In addition to her Masters Degree in Social Work and licensure at the highest level in N.Y. State, she has also studied at Oneness University in India (Certified Oneness Trainer), Maharishi University in Fairfield, Iowa (Transcendental Meditation Teacher) and The Ford Institute for Integrative Coaching in San Diego, California (Certified Life Coach). "I love helping people find their core passions, facing and responding positively to life's challenges and finding a sense of peace and presence within themselves. We must all honor our own unique paths and special gifts. Healing is often a process that needs to happen in the context of self and other. I am here to serve others through love and the way spirit guides me."

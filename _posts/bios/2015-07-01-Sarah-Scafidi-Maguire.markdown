Sarah Scafidi-McGuire, RYT-200, has been teaching Ashtanga and Vinyasa Yoga since 2005, and Little Lotus Yoga for Toddlers since 2007. She has trained with Tina Stroh at Just Plain Yoga in Camp Hill, PA; David Swenson in Asheville, NC; and the fantastic teachers at Ambaa Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga Montreal in Montreal, QC. Sarah was introduced to yoga by her mom while in high school, and has been practicing ever since. She likes the way practicing yoga leaves her feeling completely content.

Sarah is inspired by her teachers, her students, and the natural world. She lives with her family in an off-the-grid, energy efficient home in Canton and spends most days with her husband and two sons. Sarah enjoys the outdoors, especially running, going to the beach, and rock and ice climbing. She loves yoga and hopes to share her love with you.

Shannon, our resident Canadian and Licensed Massage Therapist, is originally from Victoria B.C. Like many people Shannon discovered Yoga as a form of exercise. But it wasn’t long before she began to appreciate the benefits of the yoga postures, breathing exercises and meditation and was drawn into a regular, life changing practice. Shannon trained to become a Certified Hatha Yoga Teacher at Rama Lotus in Ottawa Ontario. She is also certified as a Radiant Child Yoga Instructor and Yoga of The Heart Instructor. She is passionate about sharing her yoga practice, to teach from what she knows, and continually learn from those around her, on and off the mat. She is seeing that the combination of massage (body work) and aspects of a yoga practice can be powerful medicine. Shannon says “When we show up and do the work, for ourselves, we find balance and perspective throughout our lives. It’s what makes us smile when we don’t even realize we are.”

I work with adults and adolescents who are struggling with life challenges.

Life can be difficult and at times, isolating. I am happy to offer services to
those facing stress, depression, anxiety and general confusion. I believe that
all people possess resources to address their own problems, but sometimes we
need guidance to help us realize our own strengths and effective strategies.

In addition to my training in mental health counseling, I have specialized
additional training in mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and extensive
training in the neurobiology of behavior. I believe that behavioral health
involves consideration not only of mental processes, but of our entire physical
being.

My credentials: PhD, Neurobiology and Behavior, 1998 UC Irvine, MS; LMHC, Mental
Health Counseling, 2012, U Mass Boston, Internship, SUNY Potsdam Counseling
Center and Post-graduate training, SUNY Plattsburgh Center for Neurobehavioral
Health.

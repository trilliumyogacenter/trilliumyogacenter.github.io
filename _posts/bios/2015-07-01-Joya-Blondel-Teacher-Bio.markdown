Welcome! I am a Minister of Walking Prayer, and I would like to offer my services as a spiritual counselor.

Spiritual counseling provides mentoring in our uniquely individual process of spiritual growth, as well as support as we move through the many transitions of life.

I take a multicultural approach, heart-centered, and Mother Earth honoring. Sessions include much listening, discerning, and praying in whatever way you choose.

In addition to being a Minister of Walking Prayer, I am a mindfulness meditation teacher, Reiki master, and shamanic practitioner, as well as a retired Liberal Arts professor. All of these, and, of course, my life experiences, inform my work.

Peace be with you!

One-hour appointments Tuesdays between 4 pm and 7 pm. Other times may be available by appointment.

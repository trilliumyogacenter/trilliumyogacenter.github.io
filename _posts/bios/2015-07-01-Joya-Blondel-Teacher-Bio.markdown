Jenna Joya Blondel, Ph.D., Minister of Walking Prayer, Usui Reiki Master/Teacher,
offers Reiki, Mindfulness Meditation, and Spiritual Counseling at Trillium. A
former college professor in the US and the Middle East, she has been meditating
since high school and has taught Mindfulness Meditation at the college level; she
has been practicing Reiki since 2004; and was ordained as a Minister of Walking
Prayer in 2015.

Reiki is a simple, natural, technique for stress reduction and relaxation that
also promotes healing and well-being. Reiki treats the whole person: body, emotions,
mind, and spirit.

Mindfulness meditation helps us develop our ability to be fully present in the
moment. Mindfulness reduces stress and facilitates insight, understanding, and
compassion. Joya teaches meditation in the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh.

Spiritual counseling provides mentoring in our uniquely individual process of
spiritual growth, as well as support as we move through the many transitions of
life. Joya's approach is multicultural, heart-centered, and Mother Earth-honoring.
All spiritual traditions are honored and welcome.

Please contact Joya by phone or email for a free initial consultation.

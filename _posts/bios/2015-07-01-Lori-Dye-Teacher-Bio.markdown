Lori has been practicing yoga for over 25 years. She loves sharing the sense of balance and wholeness that is cultivated through practice with others. When Lori found yoga, she was amazed and soon hooked by the overall feeling of peace and joy that came along with the physical benefits of a yoga practice.

After completing her 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training program at Upward Dog Yoga Centre in Ottawa, Canada in April 2015, Lori became a member of Yoga Alliance designated as a Registered Yoga Teacher. In addition to practicing and teaching yoga, she is also a Life Coach and teaches Life Coaching and Meditation & Mindfulness courses at a holistic college.

Lori is known for her warm and inviting teaching style. She engages and challenges students to be mindful and listen to their bodies, and enjoys bringing stillness and movement together on the mat. She offers modifications in her classes, making yoga accessible to all.

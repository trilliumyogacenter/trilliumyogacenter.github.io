While Kimberly was first drawn to the physical aspects of yoga when introduced to Beryl Bender Birch’s Power Yoga, she more fully embraced the power of meditation and breathwork when preparing to hypnobirth her daughter, Grace, eleven years ago. This balance of mind, body, and breath has become the cornerstone of her yoga practice and wellbeing. Through her practice and training she’s enjoyed exploring a range of yoga styles including: Bikram, Restorative, Kundalini, and Vinyasa Flow. Kimberly completed her 200-hour training and was certified in Vinyasa Flow through Happy Love Yoga School YTT RYS in New Hampshire in November 2016.

Kimberly teaches middle and high school science. She enjoys raising and learning from her two daughters and is a lifelong outdoor enthusiast. Kimberly brings a playful spirit, her love of nature, and the wisdom of her life experience into her yoga classes

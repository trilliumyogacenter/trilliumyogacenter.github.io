*Sarah Oakley - Certified Prenatal Yoga Teacher*

﻿With the birth of my first daughter, I was born into a mother. This profound
journey inspired my path of teaching yoga to mothers. I deeply understand the
incredible, challenging and joyful transition into motherhood. I strive to provide
a safe, nurturing and empowering space for mothers to connect with their body and
baby in preparation for childbirth. My prenatal yoga classes are always open
level and mothers in all stages of pregnancy are welcome.  

I am a Certified Prenatal Yoga Teacher through The Seattle Holistic Ce﻿nter, where
I studied under the guidance of Colette Crawford.  I am also grateful to﻿ have trained, apprenticed and taught with Camille Mulchi of MotherWise Yoga in Portland OR. In
addition to teaching yoga, I am a professional member of St. Lawrence County
Birth Connection, past co-leader of ICAN of Syracuse and slowly incorporating
doula work into my practice. You can learn more about me and my work at

I find inspiration and joy in my teachers, the mamas I have the honor to share
space with and my daughters - the best teachers of the yogini way of life. My
greatest hope for my work is that I am able to offer mothers yogic tools for
embracing a conscious and empowering pregnancy, birth and motherhood.

I love sharing my passion for yoga with both new, curious yogis and experienced practitioners! When I first discovered yoga about twelve years ago, I found it intimidating and difficult to get into a lot of the positions - but over time, practice helped me not only become more flexible and strong, it calmed my mind and made me more comfortable in my own body.  Yoga has had such a positive impact on my life that I decided to train at PranaShanti in Ottawa, Canada to become a 200-Hour Certified Hatha Yoga Teacher.

In addition to teaching yoga, I am currently in graduate school receiving my MST in Childhood Education. After working for over ten years as a television and documentary producer, I decided to make a career transition and pursue my life-long dream of working with children. I hope to one day combine all my passions: teaching yoga, video production, and childhood education.

I love connecting with those around me, and am excited to talk with you about what brings each of us to our mat and ways to carry the practice into daily life.

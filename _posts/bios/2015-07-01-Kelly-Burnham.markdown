Kelly has worked with children in the classroom for over twenty years as a public
school teacher, a home-schooling parent of three, and now a private school teacher.
Incorporating yoga, mindfulness, and deep breathing into her lessons and classroom
is a priority, adding a peaceful nature to her classes.

She became certified to teach yoga to children ages 8 months to 18 years through
Little Lotus Yoga for Kids at Ambaa Yoga in Montreal, Quebec in 2014. Kelly earned
her 200-hour certification in Ashtanga Yoga at Yoga Vermont in Burlington, Vermont
in 2016.  

Please contact Kelly at 315-383-0647 if you have any questions or interest in the
childrenâ€™s yoga class at Trillium.

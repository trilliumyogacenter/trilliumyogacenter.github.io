Kelly began her yoga journey with a sticky mat and a DVD, hoping only for a fitness program that would work.  Over time, her love for the practice blossomed. Jump forward two decades, and that passion for yoga has led her to teach classes in various disciplines and ability levels.

Kelly teaches full-time at a private, democratic school, incorporating yoga classes to all age levels. In 2014, she completed the Little Lotus for Kids program at Ambaa Yoga in Montreal, Quebec, a certificate program in kids yoga for ages 18 months to 18 years. Kelly went on to finish the 200-hour registered yoga teacher training in Ashtanga yoga at Yoga Vermont in Burlington, Vermont in April 2016. She is currently working toward the advanced 500-hour certificate at Yoga Vermont.  Namaste. 

Please contact Kelly at 315-383-0647 if you have any questions or interest in the
childrenâ€™s yoga class at Trillium.

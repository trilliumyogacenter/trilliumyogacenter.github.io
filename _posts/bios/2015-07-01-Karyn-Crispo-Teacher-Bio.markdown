###What is Reiki?

As an Usui Reiki Master, I work as a channel for Universal Life Force energy, an energy that can be thought of as intelligent because once you seek it out, it will come to you in the way that will serve the Highest Good of All.  Healing can occur on a physical, emotional, mental or spiritual level. Because the healing that occurs will always honor your Freewill, the clientâ€™s intention to heal is very important to the Reiki process. In most cases, healing will take place on at least one of these levels during each session.

Some results that can be expected include:

*  Increased clarity to make better life decisions and choices
*  Boosts in energy (more energetic)
*  Increased peace and serenity
*  Relief from physical pains and illnesses
*  Release of unfavorable habits
*  Release of emotional baggage
*  Better awareness
*  Greater sense of Inner Self/Higher Self
*  Karmic energy clearing at a subconscious level
*  Release of negative emotions such as fear, anger, depression, resentment etc.

Karyn offers brief consultations free of charge by phone, email, or Facebook chat if you would like more information about what to expect from your healing.

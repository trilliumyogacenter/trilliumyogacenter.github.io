Our vision is to create a sacred space for yoga and healing arts in the middle of our beloved downtown Potsdam, NY. We welcome people of all ages, from all walks of life, to find a supportive community here.

Trillium Center for Yoga and Health, LLC is open every day to provide services for the community. Founded by three partners, Jean Benvenuto, Terry de la Vega, and Shannon Miller, who are committed to providing a wide variety of class offerings to fill the needs of students, from beginners to those with years of experience. In addition, we offer our clients access to wellness services including massage, medical yoga therapy, and counseling.

While massage may simply feel good, its health-giving benefits are well documented today. We can no longer deny the relationship between high stress levels and dis-ease in our culture and busy lives.

**Massage may also:**
* reduce or manage pain
* relieve headaches
* balance the nervous system
* boost the immune system
* aid in the healing process
* speed muscle recovery
* improve sleep
* lower blood pressure
* decrease anxiety

My intention as a Massage Therapist is to encourage awareness and understanding of the mind, body, spirit connection for every individual.  I will specially craft each session toward ease of movement, reducing muscular constrictions, bringing balance and a sense of well being to the whole person.

**Deep Relaxation - Nidra** (Divine Sleep)

When relaxation is difficult for you, follow the sound of my voice and let me guide you into a deeply relaxed state prior to the hands-on massage.

Yoga nidra combines a body scan with breath awareness, and adds a visual and sense component. It’s often called yogic sleep, because it induces states of mind that are between being asleep and being awake, resulting in deep relaxation and rejuvenation. There are eight stages to Divine Sleep, and as you move through the stages, you’re also moving through the five koshas, or layers, of your being. Each stage opens the doorway to the next stage, as you move deeper into relaxation.

When you consciously relax, you’re switching off the sympathetic nervous system (fight/flight/freeze) and switching on the healing qualities of the parasympathetic nervous system. We spend most of our time in active (sympathetic) mode, and not enough in relaxation mode, which can lead to chronic conditions like insomnia, allergies, asthma, and digestive issues.

This practice can remove tension and fatigue in the physical body, relieve depression and anxiety, relieve headaches, reduce cravings and desires, normalizes the body’s circulatory system and boosts the body’s natural healing capacity.

An eye pillow is optional. Feel rejuvenated and peaceful

Our center offers a variety of yoga classes throughout the day. Classes have been designed for people of all ages and abilities. We invite you to look at the class descriptions to find one that is right for you. The teachers are happy to answer any questions you may have about their style of yoga to help you decide. Most classes are open to drop in students. Feel free to check out different classes! 

We also offer classes in different movement styles, such as Tabata, Yoga/Pilates blend, and Yoga Dance. See the schedule for current offerings.

Classes may be ongoing or for a specific number of sessions. Check the schedule and specific class listings for details.

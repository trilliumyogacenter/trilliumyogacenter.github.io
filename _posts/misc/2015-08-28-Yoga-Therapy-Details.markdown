As a Certified YogaNurse® I offer practical, holistic therapies designed to relieve stress, anxiety, pain, and suffering. Combining the ancient wisdom of yoga with the science of modern nursing, I teach my clients simple, easy ways to feel better, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. YogaNurses® are specialists in stress management and pain relief.

Therapeutic yoga improves the function of the nervous and immune systems, musculo-skeletal systems, increases function of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, decreases chronic pain, anxiety, depression and so much more.

I have worked with clients who were suffering with a variety of debilitating diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, heart disease, chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. I have witnessed remarkable transformations and relief of symptoms. There is a growing body of research documenting the benefits of yoga as a viable therapy for many illnesses provided by the National Institutes of Health, NIH.


## For Individuals:

We will work as a team to create a treatment plan to suit your needs and abilities. No matter your medical diagnosis, or your physical condition, yoga therapy can help you feel better.

During our initial one-hour consultation we will identify your health concerns and explore the best ways to address them. I will listen as I assess your needs and possible treatments. It is my intention to create an individualized treatment plan tailored to work for you. You will practice with me and take home a simple, enjoyable action plan.

Follow up sessions will give you the opportunity to continue to practice, adjust, and expand your plan as needed. As yoga creates improved health and wellness it may decrease the need for medication and other medical treatments. **However, yoga is not a substitute for appropriate medical care.** If you are in the care of a medical practitioner, I am happy to work with them.

The fee for your initial evaluation is $75. Follow up visits are $60. A three-session package is available for $175.

## Programs for Groups

My priority is to create an inspiring and caring program tailored to the needs of your organization.

### The Corporate Setting:

Give your employees the gift of time to focus on simple, easy strategies to deal more effectively with stress in the workplace and in their lives. Stress is a serious health risk and a major cause of illness, absenteeism, and decreased productivity in the workplace.

My approach is friendly, open hearted, and interactive. Participants will find themselves having fun and letting go of stress as they learn.

I will come to your worksite or other location to present the following trainings:

### Lunch and Learn

One-time or an ongoing series of short focused classes. In just 15-45 minutes, I will teach a series of simple, easy, feel good techniques anyone can do at their desks and at home. Participants will feel better and build camaraderie among co-workers. Focus is on Stress Reduction, Yoga, and Meditation.

### Workshops and Break out sessions, 1-3 hours

**Help, My Job Is Stressing Me Out!**

Most stress management workshops only talk about how to deal with stress. YogaNurse® workshops teach proven, simple, easy yoga techniques that work immediately and have lasting benefits. Participants will feel better, have more confidence, and build camaraderie with co-workers.

**Back Yourself Up: Back Care Basics for Nurses**

Learn a few simple, easy, protective, and strengthening postures you can do while sitting or standing. Learn how you can make a huge difference in taking care of your precious back. Learn how YogaNurses® are changing consciousness in healthcare.

### Other small group sessions

During the practice of yoga we become present within ourselves. We become aware of our every movement, thought, and intention; of every brand new moment. Importantly, we practice non-judgment during this deep awareness. Through tuning in to the breath as we move and observe, we focus the mind, welcome new experiences, and nurture patience, compassion and curiosity. Physical pains disappear and worry falls out of sight. The mind is still.

The practice of complete awareness without judgment, also known as mindfulness, is central to Ericaâ€™s yoga practice and teaching. It is when one begins to bring this awareness off the matt and into daily life that they see transformations happen in their reality and in their health.

Erica was introduced to yoga as a teen, in 2003, and subsequently was introduced to herself. She nearly instantly adopted the practice into her daily life, finding it to be just the balance of challenge and warm acceptance she needed to grow, physically, mentally, and spiritually. She was trained as an instructor in Maharashtra, India in 2010, at Yoga Vidya Gurukul outside the small rural town of Trimbak. She spent 8 months travelling throughout India, learning about yogic tradition, as well as volunteering at the teaching ashram where she was certified. Erica has taught various yoga workshops and private classes in the North Country since 2010, currently teaches at the Yoga Loft, and looks forward to offering classes at Trillium, in Potsdam as well as SUNY Canton in the fall. She hopes that through her teaching, others may find yoga to be their fulcrum for a happy, healthy and productive life.

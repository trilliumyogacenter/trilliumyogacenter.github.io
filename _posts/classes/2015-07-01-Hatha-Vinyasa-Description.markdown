Hatha is the physical branch of Yoga. Vinyasa is breath-synchronized movement. In this class, we will flow through breath-synchronized movement into asanas (poses). We will hold and breathe through the asanas.

This class will help to increase strength, muscle tone, flexibility, balance and endurance, while releasing toxins, relaxing the mind, and clearing blockages of energy flow throughout the body.

We will incorporate chanting, meditation, breath-work, and movement.
All levels welcome. Variations will be offered and the use of props will be encouraged to make the poses accessible. This yoga is for everybody!

Wednesdays 6:30 - 7:30 pm

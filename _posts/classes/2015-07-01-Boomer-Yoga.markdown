Acknowledge your strengths and limitations, and notice what’s happening in your body going into a yoga pose. Explore what feels best and make adjustments—not to perfect the pose, but to find your own best expression of it in that moment. This low-impact yoga class is designed to increase body awareness—a key factor in preventing injury as we age—as well as strength, flexibility, and balance.  (For people 50 and above, but everyone is welcome.)

Well-suited for beginners and those who may have difficulty getting down or up from the floor.  Extensive use of props and chairs to promote a safe practice.

Tuesday 11:00am-12:15pm

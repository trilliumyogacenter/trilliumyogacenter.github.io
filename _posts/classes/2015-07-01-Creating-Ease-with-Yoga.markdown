Gentle Hatha is the perfect yoga class for students looking to release tension and stress, increase flexibility, build strength, improve coordination, and cultivate inner peace. Students are encouraged to start where they are, to work at a level that is best for them, and to befriend their unique and precious self.

Each class includes a centering meditation, breathing exercises known as pranayama, warm up stretches, yoga postures, a time for deep relaxation, and a closing healing meditation.

No yoga experience needed.

Two sections: Wednesdays 3:30 pm-5:00 pm, and Wednesdays 5:15 pm-6:45 pm

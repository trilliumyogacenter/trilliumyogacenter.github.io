Creating Ease with Yoga is for anyone looking for a gentle yoga experience. Gentle yoga is the perfect way to introduce your body to yoga and to get moving easily and safely, even if you think you canâ€™t do yoga.
Designed to help those with stiffness or lack of flexibility due to arthritis, chronic back pain, previous injury, surgery, or a sedentary lifestyle, students will learn how to improve strength, balance, coordination, and mental focus as they stretch and strengthen body, mind, and spirit. Each class ends with a time for deep relaxation and a closing healing meditation to create inner peace and emotional well-being.

Wednesdays 4:30pm-6:00pm

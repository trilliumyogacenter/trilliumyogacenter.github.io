Centering, warm-ups, preparatory poses, classic yoga postures and resting poses are described and demonstrated in detail in this class. Students will be guided in postures leading to greater awareness, stability, strength, and flexibility.

The exploration of pre-asana and yoga poses continues with the addition of some intermediate asana, refinement of alignment, and introduction to simple Vinyasa, flow between poses with the breath. Continued development of the balance between strength and flexibility, muscular engagement and relaxation is emphasized.

This class is appropriate for both beginning and experienced students desiring to focus on a personal yoga practice.

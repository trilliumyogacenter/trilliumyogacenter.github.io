Centering, warm-ups, preparatory poses, classic yoga postures and resting poses
are described and demonstrated in detail in this class. Students will be guided
in postures leading to greater awareness, stability, strength and flexibility.
This class is appropriate for both beginning and experienced students desiring to
focus on a personal yoga practice. The exploration of pre-asana and yoga poses
continues with the addition of some intermediate asana, refinement of alignment,
and introduction to simple vinyasa, flow between poses with the breath. Continued
development of the balance between strength and flexibility, muscular engagement
and relaxation is emphasized.

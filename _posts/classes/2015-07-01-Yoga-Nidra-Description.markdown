The first 50-55 minutes of the class will explore pranayama (breath work) and physical postures (asanas) at a gentle to moderate pace. Do what you can. The final 20-25 minutes will explore the practice of Yoga Nidra, a deep, extended relaxation.

The process of Yoga Nidra is truly accessible for anyone. Here at Trillium you will be asked to lie positioned on the floor and are welcome to use supportive props to make the body as relaxed and comfortable as possible.

You will be safely guided through relaxing breath work and visualization by spoken word. In this yoga nidra class, we will also work on setting a sankalpa, or focused resolution. This practice can remove tension and fatigue in the physical body, relieve depression and anxiety, relieve headaches, reduce cravings and desires, normalizes the body's circulatory system and boosts the body's natural healing capacity. When done regularly and with pure intention the practice can be as restorative as a full night's sleep It is through the regular practice of Yoga Nidra that one can come to recognize that you are so much more than the body or the mind.

No previous experience necessary.

Thursdays, 6:00 pm â€“ 7:15 pm

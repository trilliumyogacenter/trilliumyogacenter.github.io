Self-care is often overlooked, yet so very important to our overall well-being. Get ready to push the reset button on your week with an indulgent class that will blend a Hatha Yoga practice with aromatherapy, massage, and meditation! Different essential oils will be used each week, along with an explanation of their benefits. Throughout the practice, there will be opportunities to receive, if desired, hands-on enhancements and self-massage. Class will end with a meditation that will leave you feeling relaxed and ready for the week ahead! Appropriate for all levels, including those new to yoga.

Sundays 6:30 pm - 7:45 pm, January 15, January 22, January 29 and February 5

Community Acupuncture is a nationwide movement to bring accessible, affordable, and effective Acupuncture to the people. Practiced in a group rather than a one-on-one setting. Treatments are primarily on the front of the body, ear, head, legs, arms, hands and feet. This is the way Acupuncture is traditionally practiced in Asia. 

When individuals, friends, family, students, and co-workers arrive they will sit in chairs or comfortable mats. Needles may be kept in place for up to an hour. 

Sundays, 1:30 pm - 4:30 pm with Michael Ayotte MSTOM, L.A.c.

Start your day with this energizing practice. We will incorporate elements of movement and stillness that will foster strength, flexibility, balance, and stress release through asanas, pranayama and meditation. The poses will be linked together by mindfully following the breath through flowing sequences. You will leave feeling open and receptive for the day ahead.

Beginners and experienced practitioners will benefit from this class.

If you're new to yoga, this class is for you! We will break down yoga asanas (poses) and build them back up, using your breath and alignment in a way that is best for your body.  Props will be used and encouraged as a way to provide modifications and challenges in the postures. Individualized attention and/or the opportunity to work with a partner, if desired, will be available. Class will begin with stretching to prepare for the featured postures and will end with a cool down and meditation.

Mondays 7:00 pm - 8:00 pm

Rejuvenate your whole being and learn how to bring yoga into your daily life. Centering and breath work will set the stage for a mindful experience. Increase strength, focus, flexibility, balance, and coordination by incorporating elements of sun salutations, classic asana practice and posture flows. A short meditation and thoughtfully selected reading will complete the practice. In an environment of safety and respect this invigorating class will encourage you to listen to your own body for guidance and allow you to work at whatever level is appropriate for you.

Wednesday nights 6:00 -7:15 pm

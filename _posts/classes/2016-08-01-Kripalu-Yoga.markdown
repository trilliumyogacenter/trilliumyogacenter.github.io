Kripalu yoga is an approach to asana practice that emphasizes meditation and breathwork. It encourages an inwardly focused mind to initiate awareness in the body, mind and spirit, which can promote insight and growth. This is a moderately active class, although students are invited to practice at a level that is appropriate for their ability. Newcomers and experienced practitioners welcome.

Tuesdays from 9:00 am - 10:15 am

A Kripalu Yoga practice gives equal focus to the mind, body, and spirit. It can initiate a gradual process of physical healing, psychological growth, and spiritual awakening - transforming your "inner critic" to your "inner witness." This class is appropriate for beginners and experienced practitioners.

What I love about Kripalu Yoga is the way it allows participants to follow their own lead within a class. When I look around the room and see a variety of expressions of the same posture, this tells me the students are checking in with their own experience and applying the postures as is appropriate for their unique experience. This listening within  - to the body, to the mind, to the heart - is what initiates the transformative power of yoga.

Mondays from 5:45 pm - 6:45 pm

6-week sessions, Nov. 17 - Dec. 12

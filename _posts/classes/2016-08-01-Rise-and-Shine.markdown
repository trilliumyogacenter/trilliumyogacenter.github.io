Start your Tuesday with an early Hatha practice that will awaken your mind, body, spirit!

Class will begin with breath work, pranayama, and gentle postures to stretch the spine and muscles. Next, greet the morning with Sun Salutations and asanas that will build warmth, strength, and balance. A mindful meditation will complete the practice, allowing you some time to be still, present, and focused before taking on the day ahead.

Props will be used and variations offered, making this class accessible to all.

Tuesdays from 6:00 am - 7:00 am; Sep. 20 - Oct. 25

$60 for each six-week session, $15 drop-in per class

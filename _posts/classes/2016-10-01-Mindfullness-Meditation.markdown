Give yourself the gift of time and peace, and join us for lunchtime meditation.
We will be practicing mindfulness of the breath, in the tradition of Thich Nhat
Hanh. No experience necessary; instruction will be given each time. We meet in
Trillium's Healing Arts Room; sitting meditation of 20-30 minutes starts at 11:45 am.
We hope to create a sangha, a meditation community, for ongoing practice and support.

Thursdays, 11:30 am - 12:30 pm

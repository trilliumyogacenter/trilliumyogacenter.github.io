Prenatal Yoga is taught by **Terry de la Vega** and **Sarah Oakley**, and provides an opportunity for women to deepen their understanding and enjoyment of their pregnancy and childbirth experience. Students learn how to be more comfortable in their changing bodies and to prepare for a confident and present childbirth experience.

Yoga promotes comfort and deep relaxation by releasing tension, anxiety, and worry. Enjoy gentle yet powerful stretches and postures designed to meet the needs of pregnant women. This practice will help to build strength, endurance, and confidence as well as prevent and relieve the normal aches and pains of your ever changing body. In addition, women will find a supportive community in Prenatal Yoga.

Each class includes stretches and yoga postures, breath work, toning, relaxation, visualization, and meditation. Students are encouraged to practice in an intuitive way, letting their comfort guide them. The class is appropriate for women in all three trimesters of pregnancy. New and experienced yoga practitioners are welcome.

Terry and Sarah have been teaching Prenatal Yoga independently for many years. They are happy to collaborate now at Trillium. Sarah will teach the second Saturday of each month, Terry will teach the other weeks, with Sarah as back up teacher as needed.

While Prenatal Yoga is a safe, extremely low risk form of exercise, we ask that you let your midwife or doctor know you are taking this class.

Saturdays from 10:30 am - 11:45 am

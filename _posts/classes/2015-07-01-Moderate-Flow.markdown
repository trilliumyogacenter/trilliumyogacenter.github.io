Vigorous Flow is aimed at increasing strength, developing safe alignment, and bringing release to the body and mind. Particular attention will be paid to opening and stretching the front body, as many of us spend much of our lives sitting hunched forward at a desk. We will spend time each class working on arm balances and intermediate inversions including headstand.

This class is appropriate for those in good physical health with some yoga or athletic background. Contact Heather for more information to determine if this is the right class for you.

Mondays 7:00 pm - 8:15 pm

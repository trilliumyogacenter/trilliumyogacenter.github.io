The focus of this class will be to build strength, further develop safe alignment in poses, and bring release to the body and mind. Particular attention will be paid to opening and stretching the front body, as many of us spend much of our lives sitting hunched forward at a desk. This class is appropriate for all levels. It will include some challenging sequences, but beginner modifications will always be offered.

Mondays 7:00pm-8:00pm

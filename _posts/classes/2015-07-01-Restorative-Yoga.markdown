Breathe, Relax, and Renew. This class is ideal for those who need to relax fully and restore lost vitality. The loss may be due to a catastrophic illness, such as cancer or heart disease, or the loss may be chronic, due to depression, diabetes, or high blood pressure. Perhaps you feel depleted due to overwork or difficulty sleeping. We will explore ways to soothe the nervous system, release tension, fear, and anxiety while building a sense of loving acceptance of what is.

Explore a meditative yoga practice designed to release stress and restore
vitality as you create loving acceptance and deep relaxation. Enjoy breath-work
(pranayama), supported yoga poses, mindfulness meditation, and deep relaxation
in every class.

We may feel depleted or tense because of overwork or difficulty sleeping. Our
stress may be due to anxiety, depression, chronic or catastrophic illness,
relationship problems, work problems, or other reasons.  

Restorative Yoga is a time to let go of doing. Turning inward you will breathe,
relax, and renew your body, mind, and spirit.

No yoga experience is needed.

Thursdays, 10 am to 11:30 am

<em>“Restorative yoga can be a gateway to deep relaxation and the cultivation of mindfulness. Enter, enter!”</em>

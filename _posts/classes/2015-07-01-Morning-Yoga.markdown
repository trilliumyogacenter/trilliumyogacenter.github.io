Start your day with feel-good hatha yoga warm ups and poses to wake up your body mind, and spirit. Our practice will include hip openers, neck and shoulder openers, poses to lengthen the spine, and strengthen the core. Enjoy pranayama, meditation, and of course shivasana. Walk away feeling centered, focused, and ready to meet the day.

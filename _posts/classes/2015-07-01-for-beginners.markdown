If you always wanted to take a yoga class and were afraid you would be the only beginner, this class is for you. If you have been doing yoga at home with a book or a video and wondered what a class would be like, this class is for you. If you have been away from yoga for a long time and want to start over, this class is for you. If you want to take a class that starts simple and builds week by week, this class is for you.

Beginning with body awareness, breath awareness, easy warm ups, simple yoga poses, mindfulness meditation, and deep relaxation, For Beginners takes you through the basics of hatha yoga. In 8 weeks, you will learn the tools to start your own unique yoga practice and you will be ready to explore other yoga classes with experience and confidence.

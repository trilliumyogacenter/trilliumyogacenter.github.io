My vision for the meditation class at Trillium is meditation as a daily health
practice, for physical, mental, and spiritual health. I will talk about the
benefits of meditation and the different ways of practice.  We will do sitting
meditation, also known as Zazen, standing meditation, walking meditation, also
known as Kinhin, some directed meditation, and some chi gung moving meditation.
With some of each of these experienced during the 4 different classes. Each class
will have a 15-20 minute sitting meditation for the central practice. New and
experienced meditators are welcome.

This first set of four classes in September will have a fee of $40. In October
meditation students will have a $5 dollar charge.  We are hoping to develop a
group for continuing weekly practice, a sangha.  The classes will run from 7:45
to 8:30 every Wednesday evening.

Wednesdays, 7:45 pm - 8:30 pm; 4 week session.

that promotes safety while building strength. Yoga postures will be taught, tailored,
and practiced based on individual needs. Posture options and props will be offered
allowing participants to work and progress at their own level. Those interested in
building and maintaining spinal health, or have a diagnosis of osteoporosis or
osteopenia, will benefit from this class.

help build strength and flexibility, while at the same time identifying and avoiding
those practices which may be unsafe or even dangerous.

While teaching is a rewarding and exhilarating career, it can also create stress
that leaves us mentally and physically depleted. Committing to a yoga practice
has been a proven aid in releasing and reducing tensions that accrue as a result
of the work we do each day.

Learn a variety of methods that promote and support self-care while counteracting
the effects of these occupational stresses. Enjoy a supportive environment in the
company of your peers. This class is appropriate for those new to yoga as well
as more experienced practitioners.

As a former middle school teacher, I understand how teachers feel at the end of
the day. Join me in a practice that enhances a greater sense of wellbeing and
mindfulness, and reap its many benefits.

To receive the most benefit of the practice, committing to the eight-week series
is recommended. Not sure? Drop in to the first session for $10. Drop-in fee for
later classes is $15.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns. I look forward to
sharing practice with you.

Mondays from 3:45â€“4:45 pm, March 7 through May 9, April 18.

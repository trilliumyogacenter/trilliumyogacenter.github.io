Begin your yoga practice or come back to yoga with Yoga Basics. Unwind after work,
make the transition home feeling refreshed and renewed. Let go of doing; embrace
being as you breathe deeply, release tightness, hold basic yoga poses, meditate,
and relax deeply in Yoga Nidra. Keeping it simple and accessible to all.

Wednesdays, 5:15 pm - 6:15 pm

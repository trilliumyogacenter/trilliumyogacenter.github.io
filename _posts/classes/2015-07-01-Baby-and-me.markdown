This class is designed for babies up to 2 years old and their parents, grandparents, or caregivers. It is perfect for beginners or experienced yoga practitioners.

We will bond with our babies, while practicing Gentle Hatha Yoga. We will stretch, strengthen and release stress in a social environment, working with Pranayama (breath work), Asanas (poses), and meditation.

Please check with your healthcare provider before doing any postpartum exercise.

Tuesdays from 9:30-10:30am; January 12 - February 23. No class January 26. $72 for the session, $15 drop-in per class

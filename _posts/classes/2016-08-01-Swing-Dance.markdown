Swing the night away! Come learn the basic elements of Country style swing dancing. We will teach you the beginner level moves to get you dancing and then throw in some fun dips and leans for added pizzazz. No experience needed! Please indicate if you will or will not have a partner for the lessons. We will be able to provide partners for those who need one!

Four Fridays: Sep. 9, 16, 23, 30 from 7 - 8 pm

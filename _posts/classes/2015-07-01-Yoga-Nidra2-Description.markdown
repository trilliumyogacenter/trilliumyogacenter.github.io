* Can you imagine experiencing deeper levels of health, inner peace of mind and equanimity?
* Have you wanted to try meditation but thought it was too hard?
* Have you thought about trying Yoga but didn’t know where to start?

Allow me to share with you the practice of Yoga Nidra. Yoga means union or one-pointed awareness, and Nidra, means sleep. Often referred to as Divine or Yogic Sleep, this contemporary practice is based on ancient meditation and yogic wisdom. It is a powerful technique in which you are guided systematically and learn to relax consciously at every level of your being. Yoga Nidra invites you to experience a body scan, breath awareness, a visual and sense component through your physical, energetic, mental, emotional and spiritual layers. There is no need to fix or change anything about yourself, simply notice. In this dawn between sleep and wakefulness you are invited to throw off the burdens, the tensions of life.

The practice of Yoga Nidra is simple and there is no way to do it wrong, nowhere to go and nothing to do. All that is required is a mat or blanket on the floor and that you lie down, close your eyes and listen. That’s it! That’s all you have to do. Simply be…

Each one-hour class will start with a 10-minute centering, a 40-minute Yoga Nidra practice including an opportunity to set a silent Sankalpa (heart's longing), and a 10-minute integration.

Sleep better, live better, love better.

Shine On.

Tuesdays, 7:00 pm – 8:00 pm Sep. 13 - Oct. 11

Whether you're new to yoga or an experienced practitioner, this class is intended to help all levels by breaking down yoga asanas (poses) and building them back up, using your breath and alignment in a way that is best for your body. Props will be used and encouraged as a way to provide modifications and challenges in the postures. Individualized attention and/or the opportunity to work with a partner, if desired, will be available. Class will begin with stretching to prepare for the featured postures and will end with a cool down and meditation.

Mondays 7:00 pm - 7:00 pm

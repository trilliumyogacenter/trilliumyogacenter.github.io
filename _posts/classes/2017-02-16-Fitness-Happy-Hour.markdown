Oh yes - this is the favorite part of your day!

Join me for an hour packed full of fitness fun.  I like to mix it up, so here is what we will be doing:

Circuit class - we will target specific muscle groups with the inclusion of cardio respiratory activity (aerobics).

High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), class - we go all out- 100% effort through quick, intense bursts of exercise, followed by short recovery periods. The magic of HIIT is that it keeps your body burning fat even after you leave.
Hi/low impact aerobics class - we will be combining traditional aerobic movements with strength movements to create a comprehensive fitness routine that supports heart health and weight loss.

No matter how the class is organized, we will always begin with a warm up, followed by the body of the exercise, and end with a cool-down, final stretch and relaxation segment.   I can teach any of these classes to meet you at your fitness level - you just listen to the music, follow me, and do your best - that's all.

My goal in this 6-week program is to introduce you to various forms of exercise that leave you feeling great.

Tuesdays 5:30-6:30

March 7- April 11

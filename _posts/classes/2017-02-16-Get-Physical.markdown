This is a low impact class combining upper and lower body movements where one foot always stays on the floor.  Each class will include a warm up, cardio respiratory conditioning (aerobics), muscular strength and endurance, and end with a flexibility segment and cool down.  All you have to do is listen to some fun music and follow me as I will guide you safely through each segment of the class.  My hope is to reach people who are older, injured, have bad joints, or a fitness newbie as it is a great way to dip your toes in to exercise.  I will offer you a warm, supportive, and motivating environment that delivers safe and effective functional exercise to help you improve your performance in daily activities and quality of life.  I would highly encourage you to come to class 2 days per week as moving your body for 150 minutes a week is optimal.   

Monday and Wednesday 10:00 am-11:00 am
March 6 - April 12, no class on March 13th

This is a 6-week class, drop-in or use class card

This slow, deep practice focuses on building strength and flexibility with emphasis on building body awareness and finding alignment in your own body.  Thoughtful sequencing, uniting breath with movement, gently promotes ease in transitioning through a variety of postures.  Personal exploration though posture options is encouraged to make the practice safe and your own.  Calming breathing techniques, meditation, and Savasana are integral components.

Mondays 5:00pm to 6:30pm

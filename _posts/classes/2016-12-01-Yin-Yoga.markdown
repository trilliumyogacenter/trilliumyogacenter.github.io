Yin Yoga is a slow paced yoga practice that focuses on the joints and connective tissues. Poses are held for an extended period of time, allowing the body to settle into the holding. Meditation and pranayama (breathing exercises) are incorporated.

Calming the mind and body, as well as increasing mobility in the hips, spine, and other joints are all achieved through the practice of Yin  yoga.

Wednesdays 7:00 pm-8:15 pm

Community Meditation is open to all, beginners and seasoned meditators who wish
to be part of an ongoing group of meditators, committed to a regular meditation
practice.

Meditation is a daily practice for physical, mental, and spiritual health.
Long-time meditator, Ray de Silva, will facilitate. You are invited to come as
you are, sit in a chair or on the floor. Mats, cushions, and blankets are available.

It is our hope that with consistent attendance, participants will become a
supportive community, a true sangha.

Community meditation is held in the Healing Arts room toward the back of Trillium/

Wednesdays, 7:00 pm - 7:45 pm

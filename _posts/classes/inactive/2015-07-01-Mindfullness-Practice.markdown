Do you want to introduce more balance into your life and gain new tools to effectively manage stress? Mindfulness practice can help. More and more people are using mindfulness techniques, which meld centuries-old Eastern practices with more recent cognitive-behavioral techniques.

This series of four sessions (1 hour each) will help participants to cultivate their own mindfulness practice. Classes will include a brief lecture, handouts, discussion and direct experience of techniques that participants can use right away such as 1) a focus on breathing 2) guided visualization and 3) practicing radical acceptance. Each class will feature different mindfulness techniques.

Please note that this is not a yoga or exercise class.

The instructor, Alisa G. Woods, PhD, LMHC is a licensed mental health counselor, with specialized additional training in mindfulness, cognitive behavioral therapy, and extensive training in neuroscience.

Wednesdays, 8:00 pm - 9:00 pm

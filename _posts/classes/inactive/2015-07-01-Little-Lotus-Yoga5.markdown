finding inner peace. Children and adults alike feel rushed and stressed.

This class offers young children a playful introduction to yoga incorporating
breathing exercises, yoga poses, movement, music, and art.  Focus will be on fun
and body awareness. A craft project each class will give children a hands-on
reminder of the lesson of the week.

A package of 6 sessions will cost $66. Drop-in price is $12. Cost of this class
includes craft materials. Students should wear comfortable clothing and bring
a water bottle.

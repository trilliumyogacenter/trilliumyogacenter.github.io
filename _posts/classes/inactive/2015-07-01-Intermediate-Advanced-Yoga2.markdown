This class aims to build on the knowledge of yoga gained by attending regular asana practice. We will explore familiar asanas while adding additional variations and bhandas (locks). In addition to asana practice, other aspects of the 8-fold path and yogic tradition will be introduced. Our practice will include yoga nidra (yogic sleep), and pranayama (breathing techniques); as well as an introduction to mudras (gestures), mindfulness (awareness without judgment), meditation techniques, and mantra chanting.

6 Saturdays, 4:00 pm-5:30 pm  Sept 26-Oct 31

Chair yoga is an innovative practice that is perfect for those with limited mobility. Such problems may preclude participating in a standard yoga class, where the ability to get down and up from the floor is key.

A regular chair yoga practice will improve your health, sense of well-being, and physical condition. Increased strength, flexibility, and balance are expected outcomes, as well as improvements in endurance and stamina.

Explore and reap the benefits of this powerful practice. Build upon your strengths while accommodating and acknowledging your limitations.

Four Mondays, Sep. 12 - Oct. 3, 1:00 pm - 2:00 pm, The fee is $40 and is open to drop-ins, $15
